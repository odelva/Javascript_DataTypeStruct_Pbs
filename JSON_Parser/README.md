## What is JSON?

Often data is stored on the server in a different format from what is readable by the client side. [JSON](http://www.w3schools.com/js/js_json.asp), or JavaScript Object Notation, is a standard format for passing data between various components of the web. The following is an example of a JSON object:
````
{
  "firstName": "John",
  "lastName": "Smith",
  "isAlive": true,
  "age": 25,
  "address": {
    "streetAddress": "21 2nd Street",
    "city": "New York",
    "state": "NY",
    "postalCode": "10021-3100"
  },
  "phoneNumbers": [
    {
      "type": "home",
      "number": "212 555-1234"
    },
    {
      "type": "office",
      "number": "646 555-4567"
    }
  ],
  "children": [],
  "spouse": null
}
````
A JSON Parser is used to transform the data from the readable JSON format (which is a string) into a structure JavaScript object.

Your task is to create this parser that will take a string in JSON format and return a JavaScript object in the appropriate key/value format.
